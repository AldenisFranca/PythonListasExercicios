How Do Companies Use Spreadsheets?

Many companies use spreadsheets to store information, but they also have other valuable functions.
Companies use spreadsheets to model and manipulate data sets,
create graphical visualizations, and inform future planning, and decision make. 
With popular spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel and alternatives from Libre
Office and Google Docs, businesses of any size can put spreadsheets to good use.
